                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A Quiet Place was released on March 9, 2018. It is directed by John Krasisnski (What? I know! I was surprised too. I did not even know he was into directing or an action star), Emily Blunt, Noah Jupe, Cade Woodward and breakout star Millicent Simmonds (at least in my opinion). It is produced by Michael Bay (Transformers), Andrew Form ( The purge, Friday the 13th) and Brad Fuller (The purge, Ouija). The screenplay is written  by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck and John Krasinski and adapted from a story written by the screenwriters themselves. In one word, this movie is brilliant. 
<br>
<br>John Krasinski stars as the patriarch in a family trying to survive in a dystopian earth. The planet, or at least whatever we see of it, seems to have been invaded by giant alien monsters that are highly susceptible to sound. The family consists of his wife, two sons and a daughter who is deaf. The movie does have plot inconsistencies and there are occasions where it modifies its own rules for the plot, but the characters do a very good job to hold you through the run time.  The movie focuses mostly on the main nuclear family and their experiences in this hellish world. The monsters in the movie reminded me a bit of the giant bugs from cloverfield but done better in terms of their strengths and weaknesses.  The writing is done fantastically so the story propels with well justified character decisions. 
<br>
<br>While a lot of dystopian or alien invasion movie spend a lot of time on world building, A Quiet Place does away with all that. All we need to know is that these monsters are dangerous and hunt using sound. The movie does a brilliant job of emphasizing this and constantly maintaining the fear of sound. They cover their house with sand to hide the sound of footsteps, which I was think was nifty. Just like the sand there are several measures the family takes to minimize sound as much as possible. I was not sure how I felt about having a deaf actress as part of the cast and characters. On one hand it is beautiful in how ironic it is that she cannot hear and the monsters have super sensitive hearing. On the other hand, it feels just a tad heavy handed, mind you, just a tad bit. It sort of reminds me of people in reality TV shows, where they talk about their ailments to gain sympathy. But the movie still does a decent job of not letting her inability to hear becoming an illogical hindrance in the story so to speak. Although if they already had a kid with an ailment, what was the point of adding a sickness for the other kid. I know things are already tough for our characters but like every other science fiction movie after signs, there is always that one child in the family who has some sickness that makes them weak and they need to be carried or are in dire need of some medicine. In that regard, I think they played the story of Millicent much better cause her deafness is not treated with ignorance. Its part of the plot. The son’s sickness never comes into the picture again after the first few minutes. It sort of feels unfair and just reduces the stakes for me a bit. I mean, think about it, people with ailments would be the first to go in an alien invasion situation. As grim as that is, its true.

Iron City is a place similar to what we’ve seen in other movies, but it’s outfitted with enough differences to tell it apart, like making the society corrupt enough for serial killers and robbing cyborgs of their mechanical parts and giving the place its own gladiatorial-like roller derby that gives Iron City hopefuls their only shot at getting into Zalem. Somehow all of these storylines are interconnected, which adds to the clunkiness of the script but it never allows it to get boring. Some kind of action sequence is always just a few minutes away.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">“John Wick” movies are shameless yet rules-bound, littered with killings but bejeweled with old-world niceties. Director Chad Stahelski’s third installment in the R-rated franchise of one-man-army vengeance starring Keanu Reeves as the most put-upon, capable assassin in history is called “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum.” But it also could have been subtitled “As You Wish,” since it’s as politely accommodating as a sequel can be to what we expect from these movies: slickly gonzo, acrobatic, and close-up violence like the bloodiest of tangos. Just add stabbing implements, kicking horses, motorcycles, shotguns, attack dogs, and more pointy things.
<br>
<br>Since then, this world’s scope has expanded, with 2017’s “Chapter 2” increasing the number of antagonists trying to kill Wick to, oh, everyone. “Parabellum” picks up where the last one left off, with our coat-and-tie-wearing anti-hero — declared ex-communicado by the ruling assassin council The High Table — scurrying for cover with a $14 million bounty on his head, the price for dispatching an adversary on Continental grounds.From here, “Parabellum” segues into its vigorous melees, new locations and guest stars like a musical variety show. Initial sanctuary for Wick comes from Angelica Huston’s Russian queenpin The Director, who operates out of an old theater, and from whom we learn that Wick was a Belarussian orphan whose dark arts were born of ballet and wrestling training. Believe it or not, it’s a background that makes complete sense as presented.
<br>
<br>Next up is a trip to Casablanca, where Wick seeks help from an old, embittered colleague named Sophia (Halle Berry), who leads him to an Italian authority (Jerome Flynn, “Game of Thrones”), who in turn points him to the Sahara, where another high-ranking High Table figure (Saïd Taghmaoui, “Wonder Woman”) lays down the terms for Wick’s survival, yadda yadda yadda.</p>
